To run a C++ program in windows then we :
1. First open CMD.
2. Then we give the location of the file :
{
    i.e. let's say a c++/c file is on the desktop then we locate 
    it like this (Actually we are giving a path to the file) :

    > cd Desktop  (enter)
    > cd "[FOLDAR_NAME]"  (enter)
    > g++ [FILE_NAME.cpp] -o [EXECUTABLE_FILE_NAME]  (enter)
    > [EXECUTABLE_FILE_NAME]  (enter)

    > (It will display the output of the locate file)

    If we do any further changes in the code then we have to again 
    compile the code by again retyping the 3rd line i.e.
    g++ ...... (enter) like this then we have to run this to get the 
    edited code output.

here, we have specified that we have used the namespace standard.
